A Machine Learning Term Project

This project used Linear Regression in order to predict future
Population Growth Rates and Population Totals.

It originated from Bill Gates' 2018 letter where he discussed 
that as population growth rates decrease, population totals are
going to increase until 2100 where the population will actually
begin to plateau. My team wanted to explore this idea for our
data mining term project.
